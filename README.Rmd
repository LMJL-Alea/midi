The Human brain can be seen as grey matter and white matter. The former is
composed of cell bodies and dendrites, while the latter is composed of axons and
glial cells. Neurons are made up of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. The
cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles, and the dendrites receive
electrical signals from other neurons. The axon is a long, thin projection that
carries signals away from the cell body to other neurons. The axons are
surrounded by a myelin sheath, which is a fatty substance that insulates the
axons and speeds up the transmission of electrical signals. The myelin sheath is
not continuous, but rather has small gaps called nodes of Ranvier. The axons are
bundled together in what is called a fiber bundle. The glial cells are
responsible for maintaining the homeostasis of the brain and providing support
and protection for the axons.

The scale of these tissues (of the order of micrometers) makes them invisible to
the naked eye. However, a robust reconstruction of the brain microstructure is
key to understanding brain function and dysfunction. This is where diffusion
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) comes in. Water molcules are in constant random
motion due to their thermal energy and our body is made of 80% of water. The
diffusion of water molecules in the brain is restricted by the cell membranes
and myelin sheaths, and is faster along the axons than perpendicular to them.
This anisotropic diffusion can be measured using diffusion MRI. Diffusion MRI is
a non-invasive imaging technique which makes the magnetization of protons
sensitive to the diffusion by applying so-called magnetic field diffusion
gradients. The signal attenuation in diffusion MRI is then used to infer the
microstructure of the brain.

An enormous amount of research has been done to understand the relationship
between the signal attenuation and the microstructure of the brain and many
parametric models have been devised to describe this relationship. However, the
spatial resolution of diffusion MRI is limited by the voxel size, which is
typically in the order of millimeters, therefore containing many different
tissue types. In addition, depending on the experimental conditions (number,
duration and strength of the gradients and time between two consecutive
gradients), the MR signal might not be sensitive to all tissue types in the
voxel. The [**midi**](https://astamm.github.io/midi/) package is meant to list
the tissue models that have been proposed in the literature and to provide tools
to simulate the MR signal attenuation predicted by these models under different
experimental conditions.

The package is then used in an eponymous Shiny web application which provides a
user-friendly interface for the package and allows to interactively visualize
the MR signal attenuation induced by the different tissue models and design
experimental conditions to optimize the sensitivity to specific tissue
parameters. The Shiny web application can be launched with the `midi::run_app()`
function for convenience but can be directly accessed at the following URL:

## Installation

You can install the development version of midi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("astamm/midi")
```

## Example

We can instantiate a cylinder bundle compartment as follows:

```{r}
library(midi)
cylinderBundleComp <- CylinderBundleCompartment$new(
  axis = c(0, 0, 1),
  radius = 1e-5,
  diffusivity = 2.0e-9,
  cylinder_density = 0.5,
  radial_model = "soderman"
)
```

Note that the instantiation of the compartment requires the specification of the
cylinder axis, radius, diffusivity, cylinder density, and radial model, which
are only the parameters related to the cylinder bundle geometry.

The parameters related to the experimental conditions are specified when calling
the `get_signal` method which computes the signal attenuation for the
compartment. In this example, we consider the following experimental conditions:

```{r}
cylinderBundleComp$get_signal(
  small_delta = 0.03,
  big_delta = 0.03,
  G = 0.040,
  direction = c(0, 0, 1)
)
```

We can also simulate and visualize cylinder bundles:

```{r}
density <- 0.9
voxel_size <- 0.000010 # 10 micrometers
out <- simulate_bundle(density, voxel_size)
plot(out)
```

A 3D visualization of the cylinder bundle can be obtained powered by the
[**plotly**](https://plotly.com/r/) package:

```{r}
p <- plot3d(out)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
file <- file.path("man", "figures", "README-plotly.html")
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(p, file)
htmltools::tags$iframe(
  src = file,
  width = "100%",
  height = "600",
  scrolling = "no",
  seamless = "seamless",
  frameBorder = "0"
)
```
